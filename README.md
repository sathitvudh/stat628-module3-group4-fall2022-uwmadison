# Yelp Project
This repository is for STAT 628 Module 3 at UW - Madison. In this project we are using data provided to us by Yelp which is a public website that publishes crowd-sourced reviews about businesses. We narrow down our focus to bars and what makes them successful. In conjuction with this, our aim is to provide bar owners with data driven suggestions on how to improve their business. We analyzed three different aspects of the data which are business attributes, reviews, and tips, or suggestions, from the public. 

After finalizing results, we created a Shiny App so bar owners can evaluate our suggestions. Here is the link to our Shiny App: https://acterzis.shinyapps.io/Shiny/

# Code
The code folder contains all of our code used throughout our analysis. 

The Data Cleaning folder is where our code for data preprocessing and restructuring of data is located.

The code for conducting each analysis is in their respective folders.

Finally, you can find our code for the Shiny app in this folder.
